# XOR-Cryptography

## Overview
This project implements simple XOR encryption and decryption in Python. XOR encryption is a common technique for binary data and works by applying the XOR operation between the plaintext and a key.

## Files
- `xor_cryptography.py`: Python script for XOR encryption and decryption.

## Usage
### Running the Script
Run the script from the command line. You will be prompted to enter the plaintext and a key. The script will display both the encrypted and decrypted outputs.

```bash
python xor_cryptography.py
